## Overview:

The project represents the backend of a customer relationship management (CRM) web application. As users interact with the app via some user interface, the server will support all of the functionalities:

- Getting a list of all customers
- Getting data for a single customer
- Adding a customer
- Updating a customer's information
- Removing a customer

## Motivation:

Many applications you use daily include the functionality to read, write, update, and delete content provided by APIs.

This project allows users to make API requests to a backend server to interact with customer data. After completing this project, you'll solidify your skills in designing and creating a server (and effectively, a basic API) to support dynamic CRUD applications in the real world.
